## Why This Project
The purpose of this project is to provide a simple, yet effective, password generator that can be used to create strong and secure passwords. This is important because weak passwords can leave users vulnerable to security breaches and other forms of cyber attacks.

## What I Learned
During the development of this project, I learned important fundamentals of JavaScript. I used a combination of objects, arrays, function calls, for statements, and if statements. I learned how to call functions, return values, and many different manipulations that can be performed on objects, arrays, and numbers like Math.Floor, Math.random.

## Issues
There were a few challenges I encountered while making this password generator. I had a hard time trying to figure out how to ensure the user input a password length between 10 and 64 characters. However, with some research and experimentation, I was able to find a solution.
